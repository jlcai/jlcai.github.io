                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Hello! I am a Computer Science major in the Class of 2024. I compiled a list of my own personal experience as well as information I think is the most important for incoming freshmen or transfers. Thank you to the people who added information to the document for stuff I missed :^) they’re credited within this document.</p>
                <p>In this document, I will attempt to explain all of the stuff I have learned over the course of my years at UMass. This is not only limited to the computer science major (and honors college), but UMass in general. I hope this is useful in some capacity :) I will be answering everything in a Question/Answer format, but if I don’t cover something please ask me. Please refer to the stickied table-of-contents to the left for sections on various topics.</p>
