        <p>I didn't feel like going to bed, so I'm writing this now (it is 2:25 AM).</p>
        <p>Today (technically yesterday), I went to the farmers market downtown that runs every Saturday from April until November. You can find their website <a href="http://www.amherstfarmersmarket.com/">here</a>. I've made it a habit to go every single Saturday to get my groceries (since I no longer have a meal plan and cook almost my every meal) and get up early for a chance to get spinach and feta croissants. I haven't had any luck... UNTIL TODAY!</p>
        <p>I got a small apple pie from Park Hill Orchard's stall for my roommates and I; two spinach and feta croissants, one chocolate croissant, and a big bag of herb and cheese ciabatta bread from Berkshire Mountain Bakery; a small vanilla creme brulee for my boyfriend (as a surprise, if you're my boyfriend and you're reading this right now...pretend you didn't and act surprised when I show you on Monday) from Creme Bru.LA; and a whole bag of honeycrisp apples from Apex Orchards! Afterwards, I treated myself more and got a coffee and lunch from Share Roasters downtown.</p>
        <p>It's nice to get into some sort of routine (A.K.A. me spending too much money on baked goods every Saturday), and I'm starting to appreciate spending time by myself and walking around for a couple hours in downtown Amherst. There's nice live music there always at the farmers market and the atmosphere is very relaxing. I highly recommend waking up early and heading downtown on a Saturday.</p>
        <p>I wanted to write something way more meaningful with some overarching message about how it's nice to take a stroll every so often and take time to yourself, especially if you're very busy in general like me, but it is now 2:40 AM and I just finished staring at Ghidra for two hours. The takeaway of this post? It's important to take time to yourself to relax and I am going to absolutely demolish the one remaining spinach and feta croissant I have in the morning. Goodnight!</p>
