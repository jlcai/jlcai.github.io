        <p>With the closing of this year, I decided to write a blog post about everything that I've done this year as well as what my plan for the next year is. This post is inspired by a blog that I found earlier during winter of last year, specifically their <a href="https://lilibyte.net/node/path-to-competence/">"Path to Competence"</a> blog post.</p>
        
        <p>I started off this year with <a href="https://pwn.umasscybersec.org/lectures/index.html#">delving into cybersecurity</a> and the beginnings of web development. I created this website at the very end of the spring semester as a way to procrastinate for my actual web programming final (lol) and started writing <a href="https://s3gfault.dev/blog/archive">blog posts</a> during the summer with the first one being an <a href="https://s3gfault.dev/blog/freshmen-faq">FAQ for freshmen and transfer students.</a> Over the summer, I partook in more CTF competitions as part of the Cybersec Club and I also did a bunch of <a href="https://s3gfault.dev/blog/picoctf">picoCTF challenges</a>. Finally, this past fall semester was busy; I had to do a lot of organizing for <a href="https://s3gfault.dev/blog/hackumass-xi">HackUMass XI</a> that happened in November on top of <a href="https://s3gfault.dev/blog/rescuelab-hackathon">participating in a hackathon</a>, too.</p>

        <p>In terms of what I want to do next, I want to start becoming more of a competent developer and researcher, delving and learning into more areas of infosec and general software engineering and data sci. I'm currently doing prelim training for CCDC, learning more about Active Directory and other network infrastructure technologies. To build my competency in a lot of different areas, I've compiled a list of different resources and trainings that I was given/I found over the past few weeks. These are my ideas for how to progress into the new year with new knowledge -- please feel free to DM me or email me with more ideas! This list is (most likely) unfinished, so I'll update it with more stuff I find in the new year, too!</p>

        <b>Foundational Resources</b> (it's always nice to have a refresher, but I won't spent too much time on these)
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/">OverTheWire Bandit challenges.</a> I already completed the first 10 of these for CCDC training, but they're good for learning how to navigate Linux systems via command-line well. Good refresher!</li>
            <li><a href="https://neetcode.io/">Neetcode/Leetcode challenges.</a> For general SWE preparation :^)</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Active Directory / Windows / other network infra-related things</b> (I can't think of a better title for this section at the moment)
