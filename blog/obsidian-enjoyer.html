        <p>I started using Obsidian close to the end of last semester (Spring 2023) because I didn't like all the note-taking applications I used prior to it (post on that later, but it was Evernote and OneNote). I'm a big fan of customization when it comes to any software that I use, so I understood the appeal of Obsidian.</p>
        
        <h2>Hotkeys</h2>
        <p>Obsidian is a note-taking application that allows for a lot of customization, including custom hotkeys and <i>community plugins</i> alongside its built-in "core" plugins. For hotkeys, you can customize your own hotkeys by going to <b>Settings > Hotkeys</b> and searching for various ones. The ones I have are very similar to the hotkeys I use on my browser for opening/closing tabs, and for splitting that I use on my terminal multiplexer, <b>Terminator</b>. Here are my hotkeys:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Close current tab</b>: CTRL + W</li>
            <li><b>Close window</b>: CTRL + SHIFT + W</li>
            <li><b>Create new note</b>: CTRL + N</li>
            <li><b>Go to next tab</b>: CTRL + TAB</li>
            <li><b>Go to previous tab</b>: CTRL + SHIFT + TAB</li>
            <li><b>Split down</b>: CTRL + SHIFT + DOWN_ARROW</li>
            <li><b>Split right</b>: CTRL + SHIFT + RIGHT_ARROW</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Core Plugins</h2>
        <p>For normal built-in Obsidian core plugins, I use only a couple:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Quick switcher</b>: CTRL + O, allows you to quickly switch/search between different notes.</li>
            <li><b>Templates</b>: allows you to make templates for notes that you can insert. I have a template that contains the current time and a field for inputting tags for taking lecture notes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My template file for lecture notes is very simple; it just adds this properties section to the top. Here's what it looks like in source-mode:</p>
        <p style="color:rgb(140, 172, 158); margin-left: 20px;">
            ---
            <br>
            tags: []
            <br>
            created: {{date:YYYY/MM/DD hh:mm a}}
            <br>
            ---
        </p>
        <h2>Community Plugins</h2>
        <p>You can enable community plugins by going to <b>Settings > Community Plugins > Turn On Community Plugins</b>. These plugins are, as the name suggests, made and maintained by the Obsidian community for other Obsidian users to enjoy and use. If you click <b>Browse</b> when on the Community Plugins tab in your settings, you will see a vast list of all the different ones you can choose from. It's very overwhelming, so I wrote down a list of ones that I am currently using.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Advanced Tables</b>: auto-formatted and navigation QOL chances to Markdown tables. You can hit tab/enter to navigate between the different rows -- similarly to Excel.</li>
            <li><b>Better Word Count</b>: allows you to select a portion of text to see the word count, since Obsidian only displays the full document word count in the bottom corner. This is good for when I have writing assignments that ask me to write within a certain word count constraint.</li>
            <li><b>Discord Rich Presence</b>: similarly to other rich presence applications (i.e. VSCode, actual video games, etc.), now your friends can see what files or vault you're editing :)</li>
            <li><b>Excalidraw</b>: allows you to draw/highlight/etc. </li>
            <li><b>Highlightr</b>: the downside to Markdown-based note-taking is that there isn't a lot of formatting you can do besides heading to catch your attention as you skim through your notes. This allows easier HTML-formatting (span) to highlight certain key words/phrases in different colors.</li>
            <li><b>Omnisearch</b>: a better search for Obsidian with OCR support. Requires a different plugin <b>Text Extractor.</b></li>
            <li><b>Quick Latex for Obsidian</b>: as the name suggests, provides quick, auto-formatted LaTeX formatting (i.e. auto-closing $) to your Markdown notes.</li>
            <li><b>Spreadsheets</b>: allows you to make spreadsheets in Obsidian, similarly to Excel or Google Sheets.</li>
        </ul>
