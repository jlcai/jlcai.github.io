        <p>I started doing <a href="https://picoctf.org/">PicoCTF</a> challenges yesterday (essentially the gamification of learning various cybersecurity topics like binary exploitation and reverse engineering), and it's pretty fun! I learned what Capture-The-Flag's were because of Cybersecurity Club last semester, but I never participated in any of the large-scale ones that club members and executive board members played in on weekends -- despite the fact that I was taking a reverse engineering and vulnerability analysis course at the time (CS 390R).</p>
        <p>The challenges (I've done 30 at the time of writing this) so far deal with general Linux skills and reverse engineering, so I've opened up Ghidra a few times to solve some things and look at stuff like the <code>eax</code> register. Otherwise though, after following their "Low Level Binary Intro" playlist which consisted of basic stuff like converting hexadecimal to ASCII, etc, I think it's a pretty fun way to keep my skills (relatively) sharp over the summer. I spent almost three hours straight doing problems last night and accrued over 2,000 points!!</p>
        <p>I followed the <a href="https://primer.picoctf.com/">PicoCTF Primer</a> a little bit in the beginning, although redundant when compared to CS 390R's teaching introduction for the most part, but I had a lot of fun! If you are interested in reading the 390R material from last semester, it is all posted on the Cybersecurity Club's front-facing website dedicated to 390R: <a href="https://pwn.umasscybersec.org/">pwn.umasscybersec.org</a>. It covers topics ranging from Assembly to stack and heap exploitation to automated program analysis (i.e. fuzzing). Shoutout to Steven and Gilbert for teaching this course last semester!</p>
