                            <p>I'm currently reading <strong>House of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski</strong>. This book was recommended to me by my AP Language and Composition teacher back in high school because she also taught the Postmodernism course for our school. I flipped through the book a lot with one of my friends when we would wait for class to start since our teacher had a lot of copies in the very front of the classroom, and I always thought the structure of the book with its unorthodox formatting made it stand out from all the other books and short stories we had to read. That small quirk was enough for me to be a little bit interested in it and drew my attention to the entire Postmodernism genre, but it was definitely a hefty book with about 700 pages, so my teacher recommended a different and much shorter book called <strong>Fever Dream by Samanta Schweblin</strong> and lended me a copy of it.</p>
                            
                            <p>I flew through that book very fast since it was an incredibly short read, albeit a bit esoteric in the way it was written coupled with the slight difficulty I had understanding the words since it was a translated book. My interest in understanding and piecing together the different bits of information in the book led to my AP Lang teacher to make everyone else also read the book and do a project on it (sorry to my junior year 5th period AP Lang classmates). It was a very entertaining read and not like something that I have read in a while, especially since I didn't have much of an interest for reading aside from the mandatory staples of literature for high schoolers like <strong>The Great Gatsby</strong> or <strong>Lord of the Flies</strong>.</p>

                            <p>Fever Dream ignited an interest in the non-conventional storytelling of (what I extrapolated at the time to be) the entire Postmodernism genre. A few years later in my first year of college, I went out to buy House of Leaves for $22 at the Barnes and Noble Bookstore in Hadley, MA after a Target trip with my friends. I didn't end up having the time to read any more than the first 10 pages of the book.</p>

                            <p>I finally picked it up again last week and reread all the parts I read back in freshman year. The writing of this book is very easy for people who are trying to get back into reading like myself. I sometimes get lost in the writing of a book if it's too full of description and attempts at vivid imagery that it takes away from the voice/character or the plot of the story. If I'm lost like that, I lose interest in reading. Sure, a book can be very vivid and create amazing pictures in their readers head, but what is the point of it all if there's no base to why you're describing a scene to me? This book is worded very clearly and plainly with its description, and the prologue narrator breaks his own sentences to emphasize the importance of what he's saying rather than carrying on with needless description which others books may have. There's enough wit and humor and self-awareness in the narrator's speech that keeps you pulled in to see the plot for what it is, rather than pose the question of "what is the point of all of this?" The following is a quote -- it's pretty gross in character, so be prepared for general gross ick -- that really describes what I'm trying to say here:</p>
                            <blockquote>"What hit me first was the smell. It wasn't a bad smell just incredibly strong. And it wasn't one thing either. It was extremely layered, a patina upon progressive patina of odor, the actual source of which had long since evaporated. Back then it had overwhelmed me, so much of it, cloying, bitter, rotten, even mean. These days I can no longer remember the smell only my reaction to it. Still if I had to give it a name, I think I would call it the scent of human history-a composite of sweat, urine, shit, blood, flesh and semen, as well as joy, sorrow, jealousy, rage, vengeance, fear, love, hope and a whole lot more. All of which probably sounds pretty ridiculous, especially since the abilities of my nose are not really relevant here. What's important though is that this smell was complex for a reason."</blockquote>
                            <p>The fact that the narrator in this quote understands that his description and imagery can feel elitist and annoying and full of nothing so he breaks that potential notion the reader might have by subversing himself and getting to the point of his message is REALLY cool in my opinion. The author of this book does it in a very good way that doesn't seem cheesy and instead in a very humanizing way and creates a stronger bond between the narrator and the reader. The nuance is really good there. The description itself also adds a much more relatable aspect to the description of the smell that he's describing, attributing emotion and feelings to <strong>how</strong> it feels like to be in that room rather than <strong>what</strong> is actually in the room.</p>

                            <p>The formatting for this book is incredible too, as I evidenced in the beginning. In the very first chapter of the book, there's two stories taking place on the same page. This writing quirk/trope/whatever you may call it I have seen in other books, too, but usually each chapter is a different narrator or point of view. Danielewski established in the beginning of chapter one that there would be footnotes describing the different references in the text (as seen in research papers), but adds a twist on the page I'm first describing by adding different people's perspectives and annotations within the footnotes with the difference in fonts to denote different voices. This different-font-different-narrator quirk is expanded upon later where the footnote takes on the entire length of a short story from that point of view. An entire aside of an entirely different narrator pushed into the margins of a footnote! And this is only page 12, what other different interesting quirks will be discovered on different pages?</p>

                            <p>I'm only (I think) 20 pages into this book so far, but I was already able to write a lot. I'm going to stop writing this now and get back into the book. I'm by no means a literature savvy person, nor am I very good at describing the intricacies of what I observe while reading this book. Bottom line, it's a very cool read and pretty quirky. If you're into that stuff or just want a change of pace, I highly recommend! I'll leave you with a funny quirky quote that one of the narrator's wrote:</p>

                            <blockquote>"...and soon thereafter found ourselves in conversation with some girls wearing black cowboy hats, supposedly lost on their own private-blend of brain-hatching euphoria---Thank you Herbal Ecstasy---prompting us to put a little Verbal Ecstasy on them which would, as it turned out, ultimately lead them giggling into the night."</blockquote>

                            <p>I started doing <a href="https://picoctf.org/">PicoCTF</a> challenges yesterday (essentially the gamification of learning various cybersecurity topics like binary exploitation and reverse engineering), and it's pretty fun! I learned what Capture-The-Flag's were because of Cybersecurity Club last semester, but I never participated in any of the large-scale ones that club members and executive board members played in on weekends -- despite the fact that I was taking a reverse engineering and vulnerability analysis course at the time (CS 390R).</p>
                            <p>The challenges (I've done 30 at the time of writing this) so far deal with general Linux skills and reverse engineering, so I've opened up Ghidra a few times to solve some things and look at stuff like the <code>eax</code> register. Otherwise though, after following their "Low Level Binary Intro" playlist which consisted of basic stuff like converting hexadecimal to ASCII, etc, I think it's a pretty fun way to keep my skills (relatively) sharp over the summer. I spent almost three hours straight doing problems last night and accrued over 2,000 points!!</p>
                            <p>I followed the <a href="https://primer.picoctf.com/">PicoCTF Primer</a> a little bit in the beginning, although redundant when compared to CS 390R's teaching introduction for the most part, but I had a lot of fun! If you are interested in reading the 390R material from last semester, it is all posted on the Cybersecurity Club's front-facing website dedicated to 390R: <a href="https://pwn.umasscybersec.org/">pwn.umasscybersec.org</a>. It covers topics ranging from Assembly to stack and heap exploitation to automated program analysis (i.e. fuzzing). Shoutout to Steven and Gilbert for teaching this course last semester!</p>
