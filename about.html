        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <blockquote>This about-me section is still a work in progress! I plan on adding more about academics and my other interests. Go look at the other parts of this site to learn more about me for now!ðŸ‘‹</blockquote>
        <p>Hello, my name is Jasmine! I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in May 2024 from UMass Amherst. Now, I am continuing my studies here as a graduate student. My interests are cybersecurity and low-level computing, but I also have schooling in the fields of AI/ML, natural language processing, web development, and networks. I am very interested in art and very passionate about accessible graphic design.</p>
        <p>I was part of several organizations in my undergraduate career, including: Women in Cybersecurity (WiCyS) @ UMass Amherst Student Advisor (2023-2024), <a href="https://umasscybersec.org/index.html" style="text-decoration: none">UMass Cybersecurity Club</a> Executive Board (2023-2024), <a href="https://hackumass.com/" style="text-decoration: none">HackUMass XI</a> Co-Director (2023-2024), and <a href="https://hackumass.com/" style="text-decoration: none">HackUMass X</a> Organizer (2022-2023).</p>

        <h2>Art and Design</h2>
        <p>I used to do a lot of traditional painting (acrylic, etc.), traditional drawing (charcoal, pen/paper, etc.), and digital drawing (using Paint Tool SAI). More recently, I did a lot of graphic design for the extracurriculars I was in. You can see a lot of the stuff here on the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/umasscybersec">UMass Cybersecurity Club Instagram</a>. Here is a list of various awards and places I've been seen in in the past:</p>
